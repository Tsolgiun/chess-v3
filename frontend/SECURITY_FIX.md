# Frontend Security Fix: Protecting Firebase Configuration

## What Was Fixed

The Firebase configuration was previously hardcoded in `frontend/src/config/firebase.ts`, which exposed sensitive API keys and configuration details in the source code. This has been fixed by:

1. Moving all Firebase configuration values to environment variables
2. Updating `firebase.ts` to use these environment variables instead of hardcoded values
3. Creating an example environment file for reference

## Why This Fix Is Important

While Firebase web API keys have limited capabilities on their own (they're restricted by Firebase Security Rules), it's still a best practice to not expose them directly in source code, especially if the repository is public. This helps prevent:

- Potential abuse of your Firebase services
- Unauthorized access to your Firebase resources
- Exceeding quota limits due to unauthorized usage

## How to Use This Fix

### For Local Development

When setting up the project locally, developers will need to:

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the frontend directory with the required Firebase configuration values
   - You can copy `.env.example` and fill in your actual Firebase configuration
   - Format: `REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key`
2. Ensure the `.env.local` file is not committed to version control (it's already in `.gitignore`)
3. Run the application as usual with `npm start`

### For Production Deployment

For production environments:

1. Set the environment variables in your deployment platform (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
2. Ensure these environment variables are kept secure and not exposed in logs or error messages

## Additional Security Recommendations

For enhanced security, consider implementing:

1. **Firebase App Check**: Add an additional layer of security to verify that incoming requests are from your app
   ```typescript
   import { initializeAppCheck, ReCaptchaV3Provider } from "firebase/app-check";
   
   const appCheck = initializeAppCheck(app, {
     provider: new ReCaptchaV3Provider('YOUR_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY'),
     isTokenAutoRefreshEnabled: true
   });
   ```

2. **Firebase Security Rules**: Review and strengthen your Firestore, Storage, and other Firebase service rules

3. **API Key Restrictions**: In the Google Cloud Console, restrict your API keys to only the necessary APIs and domains

## Important Security Notes

1. **NEVER commit credentials** to a Git repository, even private ones
2. Always use environment variables for sensitive information
3. Consider rotating your Firebase credentials if they were previously exposed in a public repository
4. Add pre-commit hooks to prevent accidentally committing sensitive information in the future
